    "Min-Max scaling is a technique used in data preprocessing to transform numeric features into a common scale, usually between 0 and 1. This method rescales the data to a fixed range by subtracting the minimum value of the feature and then dividing the result by the range of the feature (the difference between the maximum and minimum values).\n",

    "The formula for Min-Max scaling is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "X_scaled = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)\n",

    "Suppose we have a dataset of housing prices with a feature \"area\" that ranges from 500 sqft to 2500 sqft. We can apply Min-Max scaling to rescale the feature values between 0 and 1.\n",

    "The Unit Vector technique is a feature scaling method that scales the values of each feature in a dataset to have unit length, meaning that the magnitude of each feature vector becomes 1. This technique is also called normalization.\n",

    "The formula for Unit Vector scaling is given as:\n",

    "X_scaled = X / ||X||\n",

    "PCA, or Principal Component Analysis, is a dimensionality reduction technique used to identify patterns in high-dimensional data. PCA involves transforming the original variables into a new set of variables called principal components, which are linear combinations of the original variables that explain the maximum amount of variance in the data. By using a smaller set of principal components instead of the original variables, we can reduce the dimensionality of the data and simplify the analysis.\n",

    "PCA and feature extraction are closely related concepts. Feature extraction refers to the process of reducing the dimensionality of a dataset by selecting a smaller subset of features that capture the most relevant information. PCA is one of the most popular techniques for feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA works by transforming the original features into a new set of features, known as principal components, that are uncorrelated and capture the maximum variance in the data. The principal components are ordered by the amount of variance they capture, with the first component capturing the most variance, the second capturing the second most variance, and so on.\n",

    "To use Min-Max scaling to preprocess the data for a recommendation system for a food delivery service, you would first need to identify the features that need to be scaled. In this case, the features are price, rating, and delivery time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-Max scaling rescales the data so that it has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1. This is useful when the data ranges of the features are not consistent and you want to make sure that all features are on a similar scale.\n",

    "To use PCA for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset in a stock price prediction project, we would first need to identify the features that have high correlation with each other.

    "To perform Min-Max scaling on the dataset [1, 5, 10, 15, 20] to transform the values to a range of -1 to 1, we can use the following formula:\n",

    "x_scaled = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)) * 2 - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "where x is the original value, min(x) is the minimum value in the dataset, and max(x) is the maximum value in the dataset.\n",
